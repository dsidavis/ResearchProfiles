Given a person's name (last and possibly first), we 

docs = getAuthorDocs(c("D'Souza", "Raissa"))


get their author identifier 


r.id = scoGetAuthor(c("D'Souza", "Raissa"), idOnly = TRUE)

Given the author id, we can get the identifiers for their publications

doc.ids = getAuthorDocsIds (r.id[1])

docs =  lapply(doc.ids[,2], getDocInfo)
