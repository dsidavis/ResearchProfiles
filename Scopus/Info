  Doesn't seem to work.
   Bad Request.   Seems to be now!


When we use getArticlesByAffiliation(), the details for each article is in
XML at the URL given by the `prism:url` element of the result.
  References
  abstract
  authors & affiliations, country
  keywords




How many papers are authored with the same co-author? and how many co-authors do each of these have?



Examples

system.time( {  art = getArticlesByAffiliation(60014439, max = 20000) } )
